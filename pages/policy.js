        <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
      </div>
      <div className="text left">
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and 
        online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond 
        California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) 
        that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from 
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the 
        information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -

        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, 
        the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. 
        The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the 
        COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect 
        children's privacy and safety online.

        <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>

        <br/>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the 
        United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of 
        data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles 
        and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect 
        personal information.
      </div>

        <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,

      <div className="text left">
        We will notify the users via email within 7 business days.
        <br/>‍<br/>
        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a 
        right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. 
        This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, 
        but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or 
        prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
